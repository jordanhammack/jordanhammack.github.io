        <p>“Oh, yeah! We loved Wayne; until the drugs happened of course!”.</p>

<p>After a year long battle with late stage 4 tonsil cancer my dad was “cured” by medicine, “healed” by God, and  “abandoned” by the doctors who inflicted an addiction on him that he could never shake. After the prescriptions ran out the need for relief was still there and was sought elsewhere. And of course just like any other addict the bad choices ensued.</p>

<p>My dad was unpredictable, belligerent, and sometimes just scary and I was certainly not the president of his fan club. I have NEVER once blamed his family for choosing to remove themselves from his life. There is nothing wrong with the removal of toxic people and/or things and that is a hill I will die on but that is another post for another day. What I don’t condone is the punishment of people who (just like everyone else) could not control the situation.</p>

<p>Somewhere between his family deciding not to be involved with him and present day, they also decided  not to have anything to do with me either. I have made attempts to rekindle but it seems to always feel as if I am inserting myself in a situation that I am only allowed in out of sympathy and truthfully it’s surreal being in a room full of people who have the same last name, features, and grandparents but not feeling wanted. It hurts to see weddings and holidays that I wasn&rsquo;t invited to, births I did not know about, and the endless declined RSVP&rsquo;s. But what hurts even more is that when all of this took place I was a mere 8 years old and needed my family but also could not for the life of me understand why they did not need me .</p>

<p>My mom always taught me not to want people who don&rsquo;t want you but this was a lesson that never stuck. Just this past weekend a distant cousin but one whom I loved dearly got married and I found myself looking at pictures envious of the family that was wrapped around each other in every picture and wishing that they cared about me even <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> as much as they care for one another but then I snapped back to reality and remembered that was not the hand I was dealt. A few years back my estranged aunt asked another family member for my number and I happily obliged hoping that just maybe she wanted a relationship with me&hellip; spoiler alert&hellip; she did not. She never contacted me and I&rsquo;m honestly not even sure why she asked for my number.</p>

<p>Growing up I was especially curious about this aunt. My dad and her did not speak for reasons unknown to me so I had never met her until the passing of my grandmother. I&rsquo;ve been told she met me one time in the grocery store as a baby and but had no interest in me. My curiosity was peaked when I found a picture of her as a teenager and could not believe the resemblance between the two of us. She helped with my dads funeral again, reasons unknown; possibly celebration of the death of the brother she hated? I saw her one more time in a store a few years later and she breezed right past me as if we don&rsquo;t have the same blue/green eyes, nose, and dry sense of humor. I&rsquo;ve never spoken to or seen her since.</p>

<p>Not a single person from his side of the family was invited to my wedding but a few still had the audacity to question why… hmmm, I wonder? Would I have liked to have them there? Possibly but then again I cannot be so sure. I truly struggled to change my name after getting married. Afterall, being a “Hammack” represented all the people that I so wholeheartedly wanted to hate but due to nature and my heart’s longing I couldn’t; on the flipside it represented my dad who through all of his flounderings in this sea called life loved me to the best of abilities. It felt like by changing my last name I was punishing him with one last “F” you. It was the last somewhat tangible thing I had of him.</p>

<p>My life has been full of family members that weren’t of a biological nature. My godmother was my moms best friend, my youth pastor walked me down the aisle, my cousin was actually my best friend, and my sons aunts are my dear friends. These relationships mean so much more because they are not ordained by biology but because we chose one another. Maybe one day my reality won’t sting quite as much but I’m hopeful for healing.</p>
